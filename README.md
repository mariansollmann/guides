# Guides

* [Setup](/setup) When joining the company
* [Workflow](/workflow)
* [Style](/style)
* [Tools](/tools)
* [Sysadmin](/sysadmin)

We honour the following principles for all production code. These are defaults. If we cannot apply them (try hard!) we can justify why.
* We write automated tests
* We write a test for every bug, to reduce regression
* We refactor code whenever we see code smells. If not immediately we create an issue to do so later.
* We optimize based on measurements
* We express every concept once. (And only once.)
